abstract: We propose an estimator for the mean of a random vector in $\mathbb{R}^d$
  that can be computed in time $O(n^{3.5}+n^2d)$ for $n$ i.i.d.Â samples and that has
  error bounds matching the sub-Gaussian case. The only assumptions we make about
  the data distribution are that it has finite mean and covariance; in particular,
  we make no assumptions about higher-order moments. Like the polynomial time estimator
  introduced by Hopkins (2018), which is based on the sum-of-squares hierarchy, our
  estimator achieves optimal statistical efficiency in this challenging setting, but
  it has a significantly faster runtime and a simpler analysis.
