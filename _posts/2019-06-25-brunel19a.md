abstract: We study the pointwise maximum likelihood estimation rates for a class of
  Gaussian mixtures that are invariant under the action of some isometry group. This
  model is also known as multi-reference alignment, where random rotations of a given
  vector are observed, up to Gaussian noise. We completely characterize the speed
  of the maximum likelihood estimator, by giving a comprehensive description of the
  likelihood geometry of the model. We show that the unknown parameter can always
  be decomposed into two components, one of which can be estimated at the fast rate
  $n^{-1/2}$, the other one being estimated at the slower rate $n^{-1/4}$. We provide
  an algebraic description and a geometric interpretation of these facts.
