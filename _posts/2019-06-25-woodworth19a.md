abstract: We note that known methods achieving the optimal oracle complexity for first
  order convex optimization require quadratic memory, and ask whether this is necessary,
  and more broadly seek to characterize the minimax number of first order queries
  required to optimize a convex Lipschitz function subject to a memory constraint.
