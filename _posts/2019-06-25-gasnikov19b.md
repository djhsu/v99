abstract: In this merged paper, we consider the problem of minimizing a convex function
  with Lipschitz-continuous $p$-th order derivatives. Given an oracle which when queried
  at a point returns the first $p$-derivatives of the function at that point we provide
  some methods which compute an $\e$ approximate minimizer in $O\left(\e^{-\frac{2}{3p+1}}
  \right)$ iterations. These methods match known lower bounds up to polylogarithmic
  factors for constant $p$.
