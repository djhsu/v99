abstract: We analyze a simple prefiltered variation of the least squares estimator
  for the problem of estimation with biased, \emph{semi-parametric} noise, an error
  model studied more broadly in causal statistics and active learning. We prove an
  oracle inequality which demonstrates that this procedure provably mitigates the
  variance introduced by long-term dependencies.  % We then demonstrate that prefiltered
  least squares yields, to our knowledge, the first algorithm that provably estimates
  the parameters of partially-observed linear systems that attains rates which do
  not not incur a worst-case dependence on the rate at which these dependencies decay.  %
  The algorithm is provably consistent even for systems which satisfy the weaker \emph{marginal
  stability} condition obeyed by many classical models based on Newtonian mechanics.
  In this context, our semi-parametric framework yields guarantees for both stochastic
  and worst-case noise.
