abstract: We consider the variant of the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem where
  the stochastic reward distributions may change abruptly several times. In contrast
  to previous work, we are able to achieve (nearly) optimal mini-max regret bounds
  without knowing the number of changes. For this setting, we propose an algorithm
  called ADSWITCH and provide performance guarantees for the regret evaluated against
  the optimal non-stationary policy. Our regret bound is the first optimal bound for
  an algorithm that is not tuned with respect to the number of changes.
