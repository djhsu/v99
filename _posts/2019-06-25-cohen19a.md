abstract: 'We develop a simple and efficient algorithm for approximating the John
  Ellipsoid of a symmetric polytope.  Our algorithm is near optimal in the sense that
  our time complexity matches the current best verification algorithm.  Experimental
  results suggest that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing algorithms.
  We also provide the MATLAB code for further research. '
