abstract: 'Algorithms often must solve sequences of closely related problems. If the
  algorithm runs a standard procedure with worst-case runtime guarantees on each instance,
  it will fail to take advantage of valuable structure shared across the problem instances.
  When a commuter drives from work to home, for example, there are typically only
  a handful of routes that will ever be the shortest path. A na√Øve algorithm that
  does not exploit this common structure may spend most of its time checking roads
  that will never be in the shortest path. More generally, we can often ignore large
  swaths of the search space that will likely never contain an optimal solution. We
  present an algorithm that learns to maximally prune the search space on repeated
  computations, thereby reducing runtime while provably outputting the correct solution
  each period with high probability. Our algorithm employs a simple explore-exploit
  technique resembling those used in online algorithms, though our setting is quite
  different. We prove that, with respect to our model of pruning search spaces, our
  approach is optimal up to constant factors. Finally, we illustrate the applicability
  of our model and algorithm to three classic problems: shortest-path routing, string
  search, and linear programming. We present experiments confirming that our simple
  algorithm is effective at significantly reducing the runtime of solving repeated
  computations.'
