abstract: The analysis of Belief Propagation and other algorithms for the {\em reconstruction
  problem} plays a key role in the analysis of community detection in inference on
  graphs, phylogenetic reconstruction in bioinformatics, and the cavity method in
  statistical physics.  We prove a conjecture of Evans, Kenyon, Peres, and Schulman
  (2000) which states that any bounded memory message passing algorithm is statistically
  much weaker than Belief Propagation for the reconstruction problem. More formally,
  any recursive algorithm with bounded memory for the  reconstruction problem on the
  trees with the binary symmetric channel has a phase transition strictly below the
  Belief Propagation threshold, also known as the Kesten-Stigum bound. The proof combines
  in novel fashion tools from recursive reconstruction, information theory, and optimal
  transport, and also establishes an asymptotic normality result for BP and other
  message-passing algorithms near the critical threshold.
