abstract: The Euclidean space notion of convex sets (and functions) generalizes to
  Riemannian manifolds in a natural sense and is called geodesic convexity. Extensively
  studied computational problems such as convex optimization and sampling in convex
  sets also have meaningful counterparts in the manifold setting. Geodesically convex
  optimization is a well-studied problem with ongoing research and considerable recent
  interest in machine learning and theoretical computer science. In this paper, we
  study sampling and convex optimization problems over manifolds of non-negative curvature
  proving polynomial running time in the dimension and other relevant parameters.
  Our algorithms assume a warm start. We first present a random walk based sampling
  algorithm and then combine it with simulated annealing for solving convex optimization
  problems. To our knowledge, these are the first algorithms in the general setting
  of positively curved manifolds with provable polynomial guarantees under reasonable
  assumptions, and the first study of the connection between sampling and optimization
  in this setting.
