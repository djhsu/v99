abstract: Consider the problem of minimizing functions that are Lipschitz and strongly
  convex, but not necessarily differentiable. We prove that after $T$ steps of stochastic
  gradient descent, the error of the final iterate is $O(\log(T)/T)$ \emph{with high
  probability}. We also construct a function from this class for which the error of
  the final iterate of \emph{deterministic} gradient descent is $\Omega(\log(T)/T)$.
  This shows that the upper bound is tight and that, in this setting, the last iterate
  of stochastic gradient descent has the same general error rate (with high probability)
  as deterministic gradient descent. This resolves both open questions posed by Shamir
  (2012). An intermediate step of our analysis proves that the suffix averaging method
  achieves error $O(1/T)$ \emph{with high probability}, which is optimal (for any
  first-order optimization method). This improves results of Rakhlin et al. (2012)
  and Hazan and Kale (2014), both of which achieved error $O(1/T)$, but only in expectation,
  and achieved a high probability error bound of $O(\log \log(T)/T)$, which is suboptimal.
