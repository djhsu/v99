abstract: A distance matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$ represents all pairwise
  distances, $A_{i,j} = d(x_i,y_j)$, between two point sets $x_1,\dotsc,x_n$ and $y_1,\dotsc,y_m$
  in an arbitrary metric space $(\mathcal{Z},d)$. Such matrices arise in various computational
  contexts such as learning image manifolds, handwriting recognition, and multi-dimensional
  unfolding. In this work we study algorithms for low-rank approximation of distance
  matrices. Recent work by Bakshi and Woodruff (NeurIPS 2018) showed it is possible
  to compute a rank-$k$ approximation of a distance matrix in time $O((n+m)^{1+\gamma})
  \mathrm{poly}(k,1/\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon>0$ is an error parameter and $\gamma>0$
  is an arbitrarily small constant. Notably, their bound is sublinear in the matrix
  size, which is unachieveable for general matrices. We present an algorithm that
  is both simpler and more efficient. It reads only $O((n+m)k/\epsilon)$ entries of
  the input matrix, and has a running time of $O(n+m) \cdot \mathrm{poly}(k,1/\epsilon)$.
  We complement the sample complexity of our algorithm with a matching lower bound
  on the number of entries that must be ready by any algorithm. We provide experimental
  results to validate the approximation quality and running time of our algorithm
