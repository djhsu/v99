abstract: 'We pose the question to what extent a learning algorithm behaves monotonically
  in the following sense: does it perform better, in expectation, when adding one
  instance to the training set? We focus on empirical risk minimization and illustrate
  this property with several examples, two where it does hold and two where it does
  not. We also relate it to the notion of PAC-learnability.'
