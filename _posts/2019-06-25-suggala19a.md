abstract: We study the problem of robust linear regression with response variable
  corruptions. We consider the oblivious adversary model, where the adversary corrupts
  a fraction of the responses in complete ignorance of the data. We provide a nearly
  linear time estimator which consistently estimates the true regression vector, even
  with $1-o(1)$ fraction of corruptions. Existing results in this setting either don’t
  guarantee consistent estimates or can only handle a small fraction of corruptions.
  We also extend our estimator to robust sparse linear regression and show that similar
  guarantees hold in this setting. Finally, we apply our estimator to the problem
  of linear regression with heavy-tailed noise and show that our estimator consistently
  estimates the regression vector even when the noise has unbounded variance (e.g.,
  Cauchy distribution), for which most existing results don’t even apply. Our estimator
  is based on a novel variant of outlier removal via hard thresholding in which the
  threshold is chosen adaptively and crucially relies on randomness to escape bad
  fixed points of the non-convex hard thresholding operation.
