abstract: "  We show that minimum-norm interpolation in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert
  Space corresponding to the Laplace kernel is not consistent if input dimension is
  constant. The lower bound holds for any choice of kernel bandwidth, even if selected
  based on data. The result supports the empirical observation that minimum-norm interpolation
  (that is, exact fit to training data) in RKHS generalizes well for some high-dimensional
  datasets, but not for low-dimensional ones."
