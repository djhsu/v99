abstract: 'The present work is concerned with community detection. Specifically, we
  consider a random graph drawn according to the stochastic block model: its vertex
  set is partitioned into blocks, or communities, and edges are placed randomly and
  independently of each other with probability depending only on the communities of
  their two endpoints. In this context, our aim is to recover the community labels
  better than by random guess, based only on the observation of the graph. In the
  sparse case, where edge probabilities are in $O(1/n)$, we introduce a new spectral
  method based on the distance matrix $D^{(\ell)}$, where $D^{(\ell)}_{ij} = 1$ iff
  the graph distance between $i$ and $j$, noted $d(i, j)$ is equal to $\ell$. We show
  that when $\ell \sim c\log(n)$ for carefully chosen $c$, the eigenvectors associated
  to the largest eigenvalues of $D^{(\ell)}$ provide enough information to perform
  non-trivial community recovery with high probability, provided we are above the
  so-called Kesten-Stigum threshold. This yields an efficient algorithm for community
  detection, since computation of the matrix $D^{(\ell)}$ can be done in $O(n^{1+\kappa})$
  operations for a small constant $\kappa$.  We then study the sensitivity of the
  eigendecomposition of $D^{(\ell)}$ when we allow an adversarial perturbation of
  the edges of $G$. We show that when the considered perturbation does not affect
  more than $O(n^\varepsilon)$ vertices for some small $\varepsilon > 0$, the highest
  eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors incur negligible perturbations,
  which allows us to still perform efficient recovery. Our proposed spectral method
  therefore: i) is robust to larger perturbations than prior spectral methods,  while
  semi-definite programming (or SDP) methods can tolerate yet larger perturbations;
  ii) achieves  non-trivial detection down to the KS threshold, which is conjectured
  to be optimal and is beyond reach of  existing SDP approaches; iii) is faster than
  SDP approaches.'
