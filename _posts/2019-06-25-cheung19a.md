abstract: We establish that algorithmic experiments in zero-sum games “fail miserably”
  to confirm the unique, sharp prediction of maxmin equilibration. Contradicting nearly
  a century of economic thought that treats zero-sum games nearly axiomatically as
  the exemplar symbol of economic stability, we prove that no meaningful prediction
  can be made about the  day-to-day behavior of online learning dynamics in zero-sum
  games. Concretely, Multiplicative Weights Updates (MWU) with constant step-size
  is \emph{Lyapunov chaotic} in the dual (payoff) space. Simply put, let’s assume
  that an observer asks the agents playing Matching-Pennies whether they prefer Heads
  or Tails (and by how much in terms of aggregate payoff so far). The range of possible
  answers consistent with any arbitrary small set of initial conditions blows up exponentially
  with time everywhere in the payoff space. This result is \emph{robust} both \emph{algorithmically}
  as well as \emph{game theoretically}. \textbf{Algorithmic robustness:} Chaos is
  robust to agents using any of a general sub-family of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader
  (FTRL) algorithms, the well known regret-minimizing dynamics, even when agents mix-and-match
  dynamics, use different or slowly decreasing step-sizes. \textbf{Game theoretic
  robustness:} Chaos is robust to all affine variants of zero-sum games (strictly
  competitive games), network variants with arbitrary large number of agents and even
  to competitive settings beyond these. Our result is in stark contrast with the time-average
  convergence of online learning to (approximate) Nash equilibrium, a result widely
  reported as “(weak) convergence to equilibrium”.
