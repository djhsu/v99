abstract: 'We consider the dynamics of a linear stochastic approximation algorithm
  driven by Markovian noise, and derive finite-time bounds on the moments of the error,
  i.e., deviation of the output of the algorithm from the equilibrium point of an
  associated ordinary differential equation (ODE). We obtain finite-time bounds on
  the mean-square error in the case of constant step-size algorithms by considering
  the drift of an appropriately chosen Lyapunov function. The Lyapunov function can
  be interpreted either in terms of Steinâ€™s method to obtain bounds on steady-state
  performance or in terms of Lyapunov stability theory for linear ODEs. We also provide
  a comprehensive treatment of the moments of the square of the 2-norm of the approximation
  error. Our analysis yields the following results: (i) for a given step-size, we
  show that the lower-order moments can be made small as a function of the step-size
  and can be upper-bounded by the moments of a Gaussian random variable; (ii) we show
  that the higher-order moments beyond a threshold may be infinite in steady-state;
  and (iii) we characterize the number of samples needed for the finite-time bounds
  to be of the same order as the steady-state bounds. As a by-product of our analysis,
  we also solve the open problem of obtaining finite-time bounds for the performance
  of temporal difference learning algorithms with linear function approximation and
  a constant step-size, without requiring a projection step or an i.i.d. noise assumption.'
