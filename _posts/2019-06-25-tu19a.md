abstract: The effectiveness of model-based versus model-free methods is a long-standing
  question in reinforcement learning (RL).  Motivated by recent empirical success
  of RL on continuous control tasks, we study the sample complexity of popular model-based
  and model-free algorithms on the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR).  We show that
  for policy evaluation, a simple model-based plugin method requires asymptotically
  less samples than the classical least-squares temporal difference (LSTD) estimator
  to reach the same quality of solution; the sample complexity gap between the two
  methods can be at least a factor of state dimension.  For policy optimization, we
  study a simple family of problem instances and show that nominal (certainty equivalence
  principle) control also requires several factors of state and input dimension fewer
  samples than the policy gradient method to reach the same level of control performance
  on these instances.  Furthermore, the gap persists even when employing baselines
  commonly used in practice.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical
  result which demonstrates a separation in the sample complexity between model-based
  and model-free methods on a continuous control task.
