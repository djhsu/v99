abstract: The method to derive uniform bounds with Gaussian and Rademacher complexities
  is extended to the case where the sample average is replaced by a nonlinear statistic.
  Tight bounds are obtained for U-statistics, smoothened L-statistics and error functionals
  of l2-regularized algorithms.
