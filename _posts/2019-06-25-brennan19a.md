abstract: 'In the general submatrix detection problem, the task is to detect the presence
  of a small $k \times k$ submatrix with entries sampled from a distribution $\mathcal{P}$
  in an $n \times n$ matrix of samples from $\mathcal{Q}$. This formulation includes
  a number of well-studied problems, such as biclustering when $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$
  are Gaussians and the planted dense subgraph formulation of community detection
  when the submatrix is a principal minor and $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ are
  Bernoulli random variables. These problems all seem to exhibit a universal phenomenon:
  there is a statistical-computational gap depending on $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$
  between the minimum $k$ at which this task can be solved and the minimum $k$ at
  which it can be solved in polynomial time. Our main result is to tightly characterize
  this computational barrier as a tradeoff between $k$ and the KL divergences between
  $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ through average-case reductions from the planted
  clique conjecture. These computational lower bounds hold given mild assumptions
  on $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ arising naturally from classical binary hypothesis
  testing. Our results recover and generalize the planted clique lower bounds for
  Gaussian biclustering in Ma and Wu (2015) and Brennan et al. (2018) and for the
  sparse and general regimes of planted dense subgraph in Hajek et al. (2015) and
  Brennan et al. (2018). This yields the first universality principle for computational
  lower bounds obtained through average-case reductions.'
