abstract: We consider the combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem, where the
  reward function is nonlinear. In this setting, the agent chooses a batch of arms
  on each round and receives feedback from each arm of the batch. The reward that
  the agent aims to maximize is a function of the selected arms and their expectations.
  In many applications, the reward function is highly nonlinear, and the performance
  of existing algorithms relies on a global Lipschitz constant to encapsulate the
  function’s nonlinearity. This may lead to loose regret bounds, since by itself,
  a large gradient does not necessarily cause a large regret, but only in regions
  where the uncertainty in the reward’s parameters is high.  To overcome this problem,
  we introduce a new smoothness criterion, which we term \emph{Gini-weighted smoothness},
  that takes into account both the nonlinearity of the reward and concentration properties
  of the arms. We show that a linear dependence of the regret in the batch size in
  existing algorithms can be replaced by this smoothness parameter. This, in turn,
  leads to much tighter regret bounds when the smoothness parameter is batch-size
  independent. For example, in the probabilistic maximum coverage (PMC) problem, that
  has many applications, including influence maximization, diverse recommendations
  and more, we achieve dramatic improvements in the upper bounds. We also prove matching
  lower bounds for the PMC problem and show that our algorithm is tight, up to a logarithmic
  factor in the problem’s parameters.
