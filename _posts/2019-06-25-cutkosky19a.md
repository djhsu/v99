abstract: We provide algorithms that guarantees regret $R_T(u)\le \tilde O(G\|u\|^3
  +  G(\|u\|+1)\sqrt{T})$ or $R_T(u)\le \tilde O(G\|u\|^3T^{1/3} + GT^{1/3}+ G\|u\|\sqrt{T})$
  for online convex optimization with $G$-Lipschitz losses for any comparison point
  $u$ without prior knowledge of either $G$ or $\|u\|$. Previous algorithms dispense
  with the $O(\|u\|^3)$ term at the expense of knowledge of one or both of these parameters,
  while a lower bound shows that some additional penalty term over $G\|u\|\sqrt{T}$
  is necessary. Previous penalties were \emph{exponential} while our bounds are polynomial
  in all quantities. Further, given a known bound $\|u\|\le D$, our same techniques
  allow us to design algorithms that adapt optimally to the unknown value of $\|u\|$
  without requiring knowledge of $G$.
