abstract: 'Maximum entropy distributions with discrete support in $m$ dimensions  arise
  in machine learning, statistics, information theory, and theoretical computer science.
  While structural and computational properties of max-entropy distributions have
  been extensively studied,  basic questions such as: Do max-entropy distributions
  over a large support  (e.g., $2^m$) with a specified marginal vector have succinct
  descriptions (polynomial-size in the input description)? and: Are entropy maximizing
  distributions “stable” under the perturbation of the marginal vector? have resisted
  a rigorous resolution. Here we show that these questions are related and resolve
  both of them. Our main result shows  a ${\rm poly}(m, \log 1/\varepsilon)$ bound
  on the bit complexity of $\varepsilon$-optimal dual solutions to the maximum entropy
  convex program – for very general support sets and with no restriction on the marginal
  vector. Applications of this result include polynomial time algorithms to compute  max-entropy
  distributions over several new and old polytopes for any marginal vector in a unified
  manner, a  polynomial time algorithm to compute the Brascamp-Lieb constant in the
  rank-1 case. The proof of this result allows us to show that changing the marginal
  vector by $\delta$ changes the max-entropy distribution in the total variation distance
  roughly by a factor of ${\rm poly}(m, \log 1/\delta)\sqrt{\delta}$ – even when the
  size of the support set is exponential. Together, our results put max-entropy distributions
  on a mathematically sound footing –  these distributions are  robust and computationally
  feasible models for data.'
