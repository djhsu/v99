abstract: We study the problem of mean estimation for high-dimensional distributions
  given access to a statistical query oracle. For a normed space $X = (\mathbb{R}^d,
  \|\cdot\|_X)$ and a distribution supported on vectors $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ with
  $\|x\|_{X} \leq 1$, the task is to output an estimate $\hat{\mu} \in \mathbb{R}^d$
  which is $\varepsilon$-close in the distance induced by $\|\cdot\|_X$ to the true
  mean of the distribution. We obtain sharp upper and lower bounds for the statistical
  query complexity of this problem when the the underlying norm is \emph{symmetric}
  as well as for Schatten-$p$ norms, answering two questions raised by Feldman, Guzm√°n,
  and Vempala (SODA 2017).
