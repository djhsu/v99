abstract: " We present a private agnostic learner for halfspaces over an arbitrary
  finite domain $X\\subset \\R^d$ with sample complexity $\\mathsf{poly}(d,2^{\\log^*|X|})$.
  The building block for this learner is a differentially private algorithm for locating
  an approximate center point of $m>\\mathsf{poly}(d,2^{\\log^*|X|})$ points – a high
  dimensional generalization of the median function. Our construction establishes
  a relationship between these two problems that is reminiscent of the relation between
  the median and learning one-dimensional thresholds [Bun et al. FOCS ’15]. This relationship
  suggests that the problem of privately locating a center point may have further
  applications in the design of differentially private algorithms. We also provide
  a lower bound on the sample complexity for privately finding a point in the convex
  hull. For approximate  differential privacy, we show a lower bound of $m=\\Omega(d+\\log^*|X|)$,
  whereas for pure differential privacy $m=\\Omega(d\\log|X|)$. "
