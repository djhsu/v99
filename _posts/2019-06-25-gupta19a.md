abstract: We study the stochastic multi-armed bandits problem in the presence of adversarial
  corruption. We present a new algorithm for this problem whose regret is nearly optimal,
  substantially improving upon previous work. Our algorithm is agnostic to the level
  of adversarial contamination and can tolerate a significant amount of corruption
  with virtually no degradation in performance.
