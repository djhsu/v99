abstract: " We consider the problem of unconstrained online convex optimization (OCO)
  with sub-exponential noise, a strictly more general problem than the standard OCO.
  In this setting, the learner receives a subgradient of the loss functions corrupted
  by sub-exponential noise and strives to achieve optimal regret guarantee, without
  knowledge of the competitor norm, i.e., in a parameter-free way. Recently, Cutkosky
  and Boahen (COLT 2017) proved that, given unbounded subgradients, it is impossible
  to guarantee a sublinear regret due to an exponential penalty. This paper shows
  that it is possible to go around the lower bound by allowing the observed subgradients
  to be unbounded via stochastic noise. However, the presence of unbounded noise in
  unconstrained OCO is challenging; existing algorithms do not provide near-optimal
  regret bounds or fail to have a guarantee. So, we design a novel parameter-free
  OCO algorithm for Banach space, which we call BANCO, via a reduction to betting
  on noisy coins. We show that BANCO achieves the optimal regret rate in our problem.
  Finally, we show the application of our results to obtain a parameter-free locally
  private stochastic subgradient descent algorithm, and the connection to the law
  of iterated logarithms.  "
