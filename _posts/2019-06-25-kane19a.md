abstract: 'This work studies distributed learning in the spirit of Yao’s model of
  communication complexity: consider a two-party setting, where each of the players
  gets a list of labelled examples and they communicate in order to jointly perform
  some learning task. To naturally fit into the framework of learning theory, the
  players can send each other examples (as well as bits) where each example/bit costs
  one unit of communication.   This enables a uniform treatment of infinite classes
  such as half-spaces in $\R^d$, which are ubiquitous in machine learning.  We study
  several fundamental questions in this model.  For example, we provide combinatorial
  characterizations of the classes that can be learned with efficient communication
  in the proper-case as well as in the improper-case. These findings imply unconditional
  separations in this context between various  learning tasks, e.g. realizable versus
  agnostic learning, proper versus improper learning, etcetera. %They also imply lower
  bounds that match the performance %of algorithm from previous works. The derivation
  of these results hinges on a type of decision problems we term “{\it realizability
  problems}” where the goal is deciding whether a distributed input sample is consistent
  with an hypothesis from a pre-specified class. From a technical perspective,  the
  protocols we devise (i.e. the upper bounds) are based on ideas from machine learning
  and the impossibility results (i.e. the lower bounds) are based on ideas from communication
  complexity.'
