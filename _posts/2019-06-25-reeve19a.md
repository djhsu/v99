abstract: 'We investigate the problem of classification in the presence of unknown
  class-conditional label noise in which the labels observed by the learner have been
  corrupted with some unknown class dependent probability. In order to obtain finite
  sample rates, previous approaches to classification with unknown class-conditional
  label noise have required that the regression function is close to its extrema on
  sets of large measure. We shall consider this problem in the setting of non-compact
  metric spaces, where the regression function need not attain its extrema. In this
  setting we determine the minimax optimal learning rates (up to logarithmic factors).
  The rate displays interesting threshold behaviour: When the regression function
  approaches its extrema at a sufficient rate, the optimal learning rates are of the
  same order as those obtained in the label-noise free setting. If the regression
  function approaches its extrema more gradually then classification performance necessarily
  degrades. In addition, we present an adaptive algorithm which attains these rates
  without prior knowledge of either the distributional parameters or the local density.
  This identifies for the first time a scenario in which finite sample rates are achievable
  in the label noise setting, but they differ from the optimal rates without label
  noise. '
