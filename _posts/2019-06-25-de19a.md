abstract: 'We study the problem of testing if a function depends on a small number
  of linear directions of its input data. We call a function $f$  a \emph{linear $k$-junta}
  if it is completely determined by some $k$-dimensional subspace of the input space.
  In this paper, we study the problem of testing whether a given $n$ variable function
  $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \{0,1\}$, is a linear $k$-junta or $\epsilon$-far from all
  linear $k$-juntas, where the closeness is measured with respect to the Gaussian
  measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Linear $k$-juntas are a common generalization of two
  fundamental classes from Boolean function analysis (both of which have been studied
  in property testing) \textbf{1.} $k$- juntas which are functions on the Boolean
  cube which depend on at most k of the variables and \textbf{2.}  intersection of
  $k$ halfspaces, a fundamental geometric concept class.   We show that the class
  of linear $k$-juntas is not testable, but adding a surface area constraint makes
  it testable: we give a $\mathsf{poly}(k \cdot s/\epsilon)$-query non-adaptive tester
  for linear $k$-juntas with surface area at most $s$. We show that the polynomial
  dependence on $s$ is necessary. Moreover, we show that if the function is a linear
  $k$-junta with surface area at most $s$,  we give a $(s \cdot k)^{O(k)}$-query non-adaptive
  algorithm to learn the function \emph{up to a rotation of the basis}.  In particular,
  this implies that we can test the class of intersections of $k$ halfspaces in $\mathbb{R}^n$
  with query complexity independent of $n$.'
