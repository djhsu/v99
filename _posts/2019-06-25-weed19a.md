abstract: The Wasserstein distances are a set of metrics on probability distributions
  supported on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with applications throughout statistics and machine
  learning. Often, such distances are used in the context of variational problems,
  in which the statistician employs in place of an unknown measure a proxy constructed
  on the basis of independent samples. This raises the basic question of how well
  measures can be approximated in Wasserstein distance. While it is known that an
  empirical measure comprising i.i.d.Â samples is rate-optimal for general measures,
  no improved results were known for measures possessing smooth densities. We prove
  the first minimax rates for estimation of smooth densities for general Wasserstein
  distances, thereby showing how the curse of dimensionality can be alleviated for
  sufficiently regular measures. We also show how to construct discretely supported
  measures, suitable for computational purposes, which enjoy improved rates. Our approach
  is based on novel bounds between the Wasserstein distances and suitable Besov norms,
  which may be of independent interest.
