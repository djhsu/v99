abstract: " We prove a new minimax theorem connecting the worst-case Bayesian regret
  and minimax regret under finite-action partial monitoring with no assumptions on
  the space of signals or decisions of the adversary. We then generalise the information-theoretic
  tools of Russo and Van Roy (2016) for proving Bayesian regret bounds and combine
  them with the minimax theorem to derive minimax regret bounds for various partial
  monitoring settings. The highlight is a clean analysis of ‘easy’ and ‘hard’ finite
  partial monitoring, with new regret bounds that are independent of arbitrarily large
  game-dependent constants and eliminate the logarithmic dependence on the horizon
  for easy games that appeared in earlier work. The power of the generalised machinery
  is further demonstrated by proving that the minimax regret for $k$-armed adversarial
  bandits is at most $\\sqrt{2kn}$, improving on existing results by a factor of 2.
  Finally, we provide a simple analysis of the cops and robbers game, also improving
  best known constants. "
