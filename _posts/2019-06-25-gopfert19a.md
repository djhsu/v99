abstract: In semi-supervised classification, one is given access both to labeled and
  unlabeled data. As unlabeled data is typically cheaper to acquire than labeled data,
  this setup becomes advantageous as soon as one can exploit the unlabeled data in
  order to produce a better classifier than with labeled data alone. However, the
  conditions under which such an improvement is possible are not fully understood
  yet. Our analysis focuses on improvements in the \emph{minimax} learning rate in
  terms of the number of labeled examples (with the number of unlabeled examples being
  allowed to depend on the number of labeled ones). We argue that for such improvements
  to be realistic and indisputable, certain specific conditions should be satisfied
  and previous analyses have failed to meet those conditions. We then demonstrate
  examples where these conditions can be met, in particular showing rate changes from
  $1/\sqrt{\ell}$ to $e^{-c\ell}$ and from $1/\sqrt{\ell}$ to $1/\ell$. These results
  improve our understanding of what is and isn’t possible in semi-supervised learning.
