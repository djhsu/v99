abstract: 'This paper is concerned with finding an  optimal algorithm for minimizing
  a composite convex objective function. The basic setting is that the objective is
  the sum of two convex functions: the first function is smooth with up to the d-th
  order derivative information available, and the second function is possibly non-smooth,
  but its proximal tensor mappings can be computed approximately in an efficient manner.
  The problem is to find – in that setting – the best possible (optimal) iteration
  complexity for convex optimization. Along that line, for the smooth case (without
  the second non-smooth part in the objective), Nesterov (1983) proposed an optimal
  algorithm for the first-order methods (d=1) with iteration complexity O( 1 / k^2
  ).  A high-order tensor algorithm with iteration complexity of O( 1 / k^{d+1} )
  was proposed by Baes (2009) and Nesterov (2018). In this paper, we propose a new
  high-order tensor algorithm for the general composite case, with the iteration complexity
  of O( 1 / k^{(3d+1)/2} ), which matches the lower bound for the d-th order methods
  as established in Nesterov (2018) and Shamir et al. (2018), and hence is optimal.
  Our approach is based on the  Accelerated Hybrid Proximal Extragradient (A-HPE)
  framework proposed in Monteiro and Svaiter (2013), where a bisection procedure is
  installed for each A-HPE iteration. At each bisection step a proximal tensor subproblem
  is approximately solved, and the total number of bisection steps per A-HPE iteration
  is bounded by a logarithmic factor in the precision required.'
