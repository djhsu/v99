abstract: 'We study the question of whether parallelization in the exploration of
  the feasible set can be used to speed up convex optimization, in the local oracle
  model of computation. We show that the answer is negative for both deterministic
  and randomized algorithms applied to essentially any of the interesting geometries
  and nonsmooth, weakly-smooth, or smooth objective functions. In particular, we show
  that it is not possible to obtain a polylogarithmic (in the sequential complexity
  of the problem) number of parallel rounds  with a polynomial (in the dimension)
  number of queries per round. In the majority of these settings and when the dimension
  of the space is polynomial in the inverse target accuracy, our lower bounds match
  the oracle complexity of sequential convex optimization, up to at most a logarithmic
  factor in the dimension, which makes them (nearly) tight. Prior to our work, lower
  bounds for parallel convex optimization algorithms were only known in a small fraction
  of the settings considered in this paper, mainly applying to Euclidean ($\ell_2$)
  and $\ell_\infty$ spaces. Our work provides a more general and streamlined approach
  for proving lower bounds in the setting of parallel convex optimization. '
