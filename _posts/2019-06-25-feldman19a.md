abstract: Algorithmic stability is a classical approach to understanding and analysis
  of the generalization error of learning algorithms. A notable weakness of most stability-based
  generalization bounds is that they hold only in expectation. Generalization with
  high probability has been established in a landmark paper of Bousquet and Elisseeff
  (2001) albeit at the expense of an additional $\sqrt{n}$ factor in the bound. Specifically,
  their bound on the estimation error of any $\gamma$-uniformly stable learning algorithm
  on $n$ samples and range in $[0,1]$ is $O(\gamma \sqrt{n \log(1/\delta)} + \sqrt{\log(1/\delta)/n})$
  with probability  $\geq 1-\delta$. The $\sqrt{n}$ overhead makes the bound vacuous
  in the common settings where $\gamma \geq 1/\sqrt{n}$. A stronger bound was recently
  proved by the authors (Feldman and Vondrak, 2018) that reduces the overhead to at
  most $O(n^{1/4})$. Still, both of these results give optimal generalization bounds
  only when $\gamma = O(1/n)$. We prove a nearly tight bound of $O(\gamma \log(n)\log(n/\delta)
  + \sqrt{\log(1/\delta)/n})$ on the estimation error of any $\gamma$-uniformly stable
  algorithm. It implies that for algorithms that are uniformly stable with $\gamma
  = O(1/\sqrt{n})$, estimation error is essentially the same as the sampling error.
  Our result leads to the first high-probability generalization bounds for multi-pass
  stochastic gradient descent and regularized ERM for stochastic convex problems with
  nearly optimal rate â€” resolving open problems in prior work. Our proof technique
  is new and we introduce several analysis tools that might find additional applications.
