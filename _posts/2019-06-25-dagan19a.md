abstract: Statistical learning theory has largely focused on learning and generalization
  given independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples. Motivated by applications
  involving time-series data, there has been a growing literature on learning and
  generalization in settings where data is sampled from an ergodic process. This work
  has also developed complexity measures, which appropriately extend the notion of
  Rademacher complexity to bound the generalization error and learning rates of hypothesis
  classes in this setting. Rather than time-series data, our work is  motivated  by
  settings where data  is sampled on a network or a spatial domain, and thus do not
  fit well within the framework of prior work. We provide learning and generalization
  bounds for data that are complexly dependent, yet their distribution satisfies the
  standard Dobrushin’s condition. Indeed, we show that the standard complexity measures
  of Gaussian and Rademacher complexities and VC dimension are sufficient measures
  of complexity for the purposes of bounding the generalization error and learning
  rates of hypothesis classes in our setting. Moreover, our generalization bounds
  only degrade by constant factors compared to their i.i.d. analogs, and our learnability
  bounds degrade by log factors in the size of the training set.
