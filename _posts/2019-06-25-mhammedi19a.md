abstract: 'We aim to design adaptive online learning algorithms that take advantage
  of any special structure that might be present in the learning task at hand, with
  as little manual tuning by the user as possible. A fundamental obstacle that comes
  up in the design of such adaptive algorithms is to calibrate a so-called step-size
  or learning rate hyperparameter depending on variance, gradient norms, etc. A recent
  technique promises to overcome this difficulty by maintaining multiple learning
  rates in parallel. This technique has been applied in the MetaGrad algorithm for
  online convex optimization and the Squint algorithm for prediction with expert advice.
  However, in both cases the user still has to provide in advance a Lipschitz hyperparameter
  that bounds the norm of the gradients. Although this hyperparameter is typically
  not available in advance, tuning it correctly is crucial: if it is set too small,
  the methods may fail completely; but if it is taken too large, performance deteriorates
  significantly. In the present work we remove this Lipschitz hyperparameter by designing
  new versions of MetaGrad and Squint that adapt to its optimal value automatically.
  We achieve this by dynamically updating the set of active learning rates. For MetaGrad,
  we further improve the computational efficiency of handling constraints on the domain
  of prediction, and we remove the need to specify the number of rounds in advance.'
