abstract: 'In this paper we study the two inference problems of detection and reconstruction
  in the context of planted structures in sparse Erdős-Rényi random graphs $\mathcal
  G(n,\lambda/n)$ with fixed average degree $\lambda>0$. Motivated by a problem of
  communication security, we focus on the case where the planted structure consists
  in the addition of a tree graph.  In the case of planted line graphs, we establish
  the following phase diagram for detection and reconstruction. In a low density region
  where the average degree $\lambda$ of the original graph is below some critical
  value $\lambda_c=1$, both detection and reconstruction go from  impossible to easy
  as the line length $K$ crosses some critical value $K^*=\ln(n)/\ln(1/\lambda)$,
  where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph. In a high density region where $\lambda>\lambda_c$,
  detection goes from impossible to easy as $K$ goes from $o(\sqrt{n})$ to $\omega(\sqrt{n})$.
  In contrast, reconstruction remains impossible so long as $K=o(n)$.  We then consider
  planted $D$-ary trees of varying depth $h$ and $2\le D\le O(1)$. For these we identify
  a low-density region $\lambda<\lambda_D$, where $\lambda_D$ is the threshold for
  emergence of the $D$-core in Erdős-Rényi random graphs $\mathcal G(n,\lambda/n)$
  for which the following holds. There is a threshold $h*=g(D)\ln(\ln(n))$ with the
  following properties. Detection goes from impossible to feasible as $h$ crosses
  $h*$. Interestingly, we show that only partial reconstruction is feasible at best
  for $h\ge h*$. We conjecture a similar picture to hold for $D$-ary trees as for
  lines in the high-density region $\lambda>\lambda_D$, but confirm only the following
  part of this picture: Detection is easy for $D$-ary trees of size $\omega(\sqrt{n})$,
  while at best only partial reconstruction is feasible for $D$-ary trees of any size
  $o(n)$. These results provide a clear contrast with the corresponding picture for
  detection and reconstruction of {\em low rank} planted structures, such as dense
  subgraphs and block communities.  In the examples we study, there is i) an absence
  of hard phases for both detection and reconstruction, and ii) a discrepancy between
  detection and reconstruction, the latter being impossible for a wide range of parameters
  where detection is easy. The latter property does not hold for previously studied
  low rank planted structures.'
