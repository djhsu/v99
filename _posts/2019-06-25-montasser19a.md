abstract: We study the question of learning an adversarially robust predictor. We
  show that any hypothesis class $\mathcal{H}$ with finite VC dimension is robustly
  PAC learnable with an \emph{improper} learning rule. The requirement of being improper
  is necessary as we exhibit examples of hypothesis classes $\mathcal{H}$ with finite
  VC dimension that are \emph{not} robustly PAC learnable with any \emph{proper} learning
  rule.
