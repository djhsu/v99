abstract: We provide a novel computer-assisted technique for systematically analyzing
  first-order methods for optimization. In contrast with previous works, the approach
  is particularly suited for handling sublinear convergence rates and stochastic oracles.
  The technique relies on semidefinite programming and potential functions. It allows
  simultaneously obtaining worst-case guarantees on the behavior of those algorithms,
  and assisting in choosing appropriate parameters for tuning their worst-case performances.
  The technique also benefits from comfortable tightness guarantees, meaning that
  unsatisfactory results can be improved only by changing the setting. We use the
  approach for analyzing deterministic and stochastic first-order methods under different
  assumptions on the nature of the stochastic noise. Among others, we treat unstructured
  noise with bounded variance, different noise models arising in over-parametrized
  expectation minimization problems, and randomized block-coordinate descent schemes.
