abstract: We design new algorithms for the combinatorial pure exploration problem
  in the multi-arm bandit framework. In this problem, we are given $K$ distributions
  and a collection of subsets $\mathcal{V} \subset 2^{[K]}$ of these distributions,
  and we would like to find the subset $v \in \mathcal{V}$ that has largest mean,
  while collecting, in a sequential fashion, as few samples from the distributions
  as possible. In both the fixed budget and fixed confidence settings, our algorithms
  achieve new sample-complexity bounds that provide polynomial improvements on previous
  results in some settings. Via an information-theoretic lower bound, we show that
  no approach based on uniform sampling can improve on ours in any regime, yielding
  the first interactive algorithms for this problem with this basic property.  Computationally,
  we show how to efficiently implement our fixed confidence algorithm whenever $\mathcal{V}$
  supports efficient linear optimization.  Our results involve precise concentration-of-measure
  arguments and a new algorithm for linear programming with exponentially many constraints.
