abstract: 'A common challenge in nonparametric inference is its high computational
  complexity when data volume is large. In this paper, we develop computationally
  efficient nonparametric testing by employing a random projection strategy. In the
  specific kernel ridge regression setup, a simple distance-based test statistic is
  proposed. Notably, we derive the minimum number of random projections that is sufficient
  for achieving testing optimality in terms of the minimax rate. As a by-product,
  the lower bound of projection dimension for minimax optimal estimation derived in
  Yang (2017) is proven to be sharp. One technical contribution is to establish upper
  bounds for a range of tail sums of empirical kernel eigenvalues. '
