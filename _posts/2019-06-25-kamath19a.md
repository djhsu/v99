abstract: 'We present novel, computationally efficient, and differentially private
  algorithms for two fundamental high-dimensional learning problems: learning a multivariate
  Gaussian and learning a product distribution over the Boolean hypercube in total
  variation distance.  The sample complexity of our algorithms nearly matches the
  sample complexity of the optimal non-private learners for these tasks in a wide
  range of parameters, showing that privacy comes essentially for free for these problems.  In
  particular, in contrast to previous approaches, our algorithm for learning Gaussians
  does not require strong a priori bounds on the range of the parameters.  Our algorithms
  introduce a novel technical approach to reducing the sensitivity of the estimation
  procedure that we call recursive private preconditioning.'
