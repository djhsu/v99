abstract: 'We continue the study of statistical/computational tradeoffs in learning
  robust classifiers, following the recent work of Bubeck, Lee, Price and Razenshteyn
  who showed examples of classification tasks where (a) an efficient robust classifier
  exists, in the small-perturbation regime; (b) a non-robust classifier can be learned
  efficiently; but (c) it is computationally hard to learn a robust classifier, assuming
  the hardness of factoring large numbers. Indeed, the question of whether a robust
  classifier for their task exists in the large perturbation regime seems related
  to important open questions in computational number theory. In this work, we extend
  their work in three directions. First, we demonstrate classification tasks where
  computationally efficient robust classification is impossible, even when computationally
  unbounded robust classifiers exist. For this, we rely on the existence of average-case
  hard functions, requiring no cryptographic assumptions. Second, we show hard-to-robustly-learn
  classification tasks in the large-perturbation regime. Namely, we show that even
  though an efficient classifier that is very robust (namely, tolerant to large perturbations)
  exists, it is computationally hard to learn any non-trivial robust classifier. Our
  first construction relies on the existence of one-way functions, a minimal assumption
  in cryptography, and the second on the hardness of the learning parity with noise
  problem. In the latter setting, not only does a non-robust classifier exist, but
  also an efficient algorithm that generates fresh new labeled samples given access
  to polynomially many training examples (termed as generation by Kearns et al. (1994)).
  Third, we show that any such counterexample implies the existence of cryptographic
  primitives such as one-way functions or even forms of public-key encryption. This
  leads us to a win-win scenario: either we can quickly learn an efficient robust
  classifier, or we can construct new instances of popular and useful cryptographic
  primitives.'
