abstract: 'Robust mean estimation is the problem of estimating the mean $\mu \in \mathbb{R}^d$
  of a $d$-dimensional distribution $D$ from a list of independent samples, an $\varepsilon$-fraction
  of which have been arbitrarily corrupted by a malicious adversary. Recent algorithmic
  progress has resulted in the first polynomial-time algorithms which achieve \emph{dimension-independent}
  rates of error: for instance, if $D$ has covariance $I$, in polynomial-time one
  may find $\hat{\mu}$ with $\|\mu - \hat{\mu}\| \leq O(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$. However,
  error rates achieved by current polynomial-time algorithms, while dimension-independent,
  are sub-optimal in many natural settings, such as when $D$ is sub-Gaussian, or has
  bounded $4$-th moments. In this work we give worst-case complexity-theoretic evidence
  that improving on the error rates of current polynomial-time algorithms for robust
  mean estimation may be computationally intractable in natural settings. We show
  that several natural approaches to improving error rates of current polynomial-time
  robust mean estimation algorithms would imply efficient algorithms for the small-set
  expansion problem, refuting Raghavendra and Steurerâ€™s small-set expansion hypothesis
  (so long as $P \neq NP$). We also give the first direct reduction to the robust
  mean estimation problem, starting from a plausible but nonstandard variant of the
  small-set expansion problem.'
