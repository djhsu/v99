abstract: We study the sample complexity of model-based reinforcement learning (henceforth
  RL) in general contextual decision processes that require strategic exploration
  to find a near-optimal policy. We design new algorithms for RL with a generic model
  class and analyze their statistical properties. Our algorithms have sample complexity
  governed by a new structural parameter called the witness rank, which we show to
  be small in several settings of interest, including factored MDPs. We also show
  that the witness rank is never larger than the recently proposed Bellman rank parameter
  governing the sample complexity of the model-free algorithm OLIVE (Jiang et al.,
  2017), the only other provably sample-efficient algorithm for global exploration
  at this level of generality. Focusing on the special case of factored MDPs, we prove
  an exponential lower bound for a general class of model-free approaches, including
  OLIVE, which, when combined with our algorithmic results, demonstrates exponential
  separation between model-based and model-free RL in some rich-observation settings.
