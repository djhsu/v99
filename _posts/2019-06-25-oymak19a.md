abstract: We study discrete time dynamical systems governed by the state equation
  $h_{t+1}=\phi(Ah_t+Bu_t)$. Here $A,B$ are weight matrices, $\phi$ is an activation
  function, and $u_t$ is the input data. This relation is the backbone of recurrent
  neural networks (e.g.Â LSTMs) which have broad applications in sequential learning
  tasks. We utilize stochastic gradient descent to learn the weight matrices from
  a finite input/state trajectory $\{u_t,h_t\}_{t=0}^N$. We prove that SGD estimate
  linearly converges to the ground truth weights while using near-optimal sample size.
  Our results apply to increasing activations whose derivatives are bounded away from
  zero. The analysis is based on i) a novel SGD convergence result with nonlinear
  activations and ii) careful statistical characterization of the state vector. Numerical
  experiments verify the fast convergence of SGD on ReLU and leaky ReLU in consistence
  with our theory.
