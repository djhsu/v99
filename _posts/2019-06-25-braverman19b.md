abstract: " We study a strategic version of the multi-armed bandit problem, where
  each arm is an individual strategic agent and we, the principal, pull one arm each
  round. When pulled, the arm receives some private reward $v_a$ and can choose an
  amount $x_a$ to pass on to the principal (keeping $v_a-x_a$ for itself). All non-pulled
  arms get reward $0$. Each strategic arm tries to maximize its own utility over the
  course of $T$ rounds. Our goal is to design an algorithm for the principal incentivizing
  these arms to pass on as much of their private rewards as possible. When private
  rewards are stochastically drawn each round ($v_a^t \\leftarrow D_a$), we show that:
  \\begin{itemize} \\item Algorithms that perform well in the classic adversarial
  multi-armed bandit setting necessarily perform poorly: For all algorithms that guarantee
  low regret in an adversarial setting, there exist distributions $D_1,\\ldots,D_k$
  and an $o(T)$-approximate Nash equilibrium for the arms where the principal receives
  reward $o(T)$.  \\item There exists an algorithm for the principal that induces
  a game among the arms where each arm has a dominant strategy. Moreover, for every
  $o(T)$-approximate Nash equilibrium, the principal receives expected reward $\\mu’T
  - o(T)$, where $\\mu’$ is the second-largest of the means $\\mathbb{E}[D_{a}]$.
  This algorithm maintains its guarantee if the arms are non-strategic ($x_a = v_a$),
  and also if there is a mix of strategic and non-strategic arms. \\end{itemize}"
