abstract: We prove that, for a broad range of problems, maximum-a-posteriori (MAP)
  estimation and approximate sampling of the posterior are at least as computationally
  difficult as maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation. By way of illustration, we show
  how hardness results for ML estimation of mixtures of Gaussians and topic models
  carry over to MAP estimation and approximate sampling under commonly used priors.
