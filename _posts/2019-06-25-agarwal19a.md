abstract: We consider  online learning in an adversarial, non-convex setting under
  the assumption that the learner has an access to an offline optimization oracle.  In
  the general setting of prediction with expert advice, Hazan and Koren established
  that in the optimization-oracle model, online learning requires exponentially more
  computation than statistical learning.  In this paper we show that by slightly strengthening
  the oracle model, the online and the statistical learning models become computationally
  equivalent. Our result holds for any Lipschitz and bounded (but not necessarily
  convex) function.  As an application we demonstrate how the offline oracle enables
  efficient computation of an equilibrium in non-convex games, that include GAN (generative
  adversarial networks) as a special case.
