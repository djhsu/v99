abstract: 'We consider convex optimization problems with the objective function having
  Lipshitz-continuous $p$-th order derivative, where $p\geq 1$. We propose a new tensor
  method, which closes the gap between the lower  $\Omega\left(\e^{-\frac{2}{3p+1}}
  \right)$ and upper $O\left(\e^{-\frac{1}{p+1}} \right)$ iteration complexity bounds
  for this class of optimization problems. We also consider uniformly convex functions,
  and show how the proposed method can be accelerated under this additional assumption.
  Moreover, we introduce a $p$-th order condition number which naturally arises in
  the complexity analysis of tensor methods under this assumption.  Finally, we make
  a numerical study of the proposed optimal method and show that in practice it is
  faster than the best known accelerated tensor method. We also compare the performance
  of tensor methods for $p=2$ and $p=3$ and show that the 3rd-order method is superior
  to the 2nd-order method in practice. '
