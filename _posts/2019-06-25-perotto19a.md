abstract: 'We formalize a particular class of problems called \textit{survival multiarmed
  bandits} (S-MAB), which constitutes a modified version of \textit{budgeted multiarmed
  bandits} (B-MAB) where a true \textit{risk of ruin} must be considered, bringing
  it closer to \textit{risk-averse multiarmed bandits} (RA-MAB). In a S-MAB, pulling
  an arm can result in both positive and negative rewards. The agent has an initial
  budget that evolves in time with the received rewards. The goal is finding a good
  \textit{exploration-exploitation-safety} trade-off, maximizing rewards while minimizing
  the probability of getting ruined (i.e. hitting a negative budget). Such simple
  and until now neglected modification in the MAB statement changes the way to approach
  the problem, asking for adapted algorithms and specific analytical tools, and also
  make it more likely related to some important real-world applications. We are interested
  in the following open problems which stem from such new MAB definition: (a) how
  can the regret be meaningfully defined in formal terms for a S-MAB given its multiobjective
  optimization nature? (b) can a S-MAB be reduced to a RA-MAB or a B-MAB, transferring
  their theoretical guarantees? (c) what kind of method or strategy must an agent
  follow to optimally solve a S-MAB?'
