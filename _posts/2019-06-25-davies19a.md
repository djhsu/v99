abstract: " We study the problem of learning a node-labeled tree given independent
  traces from an appropriately defined deletion channel. This problem, tree trace
  reconstruction, generalizes string trace reconstruction, which corresponds to the
  tree being a path. For many classes of trees, including complete trees and spiders,
  we provide algorithms that reconstruct the labels using only a polynomial number
  of traces. This exhibits a stark contrast to known results on string trace reconstruction,
  which require exponentially many traces, and where a central open problem is to
  determine whether a polynomial number of traces suffice. Our techniques combine
  novel combinatorial and complex analytic methods."
