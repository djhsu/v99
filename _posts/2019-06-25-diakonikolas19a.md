abstract: 'We study distribution testing with communication and memory constraints  in
  the following computational models: (1) The {\em one-pass streaming model}  where
  the goal is to minimize the sample complexity of the protocol subject to a memory
  constraint, and (2) A {\em distributed model} where the data samples reside at multiple
  machines and the goal is to minimize the communication cost of the protocol. In
  both these models, we provide efficient algorithms for uniformity/identity testing
  (goodness of fit) and closeness testing (two sample testing). Moreover, we show
  nearly-tight lower bounds on (1) the sample complexity of any one-pass streaming
  tester for uniformity, subject to the memory constraint,  and (2) the communication
  cost of any uniformity testing protocol,  in a restricted “one-pass” model of communication.'
