abstract: 'We give a spectral algorithm for decomposing overcomplete order-4 tensors,
  so long as their components satisfy an algebraic non-degeneracy condition that holds
  for nearly all (all but an algebraic set of measure $0$) tensors over $(\mathbb{R}^d)^{\otimes
  4}$ with rank $n \le d^2$. Our algorithm is robust to adversarial perturbations
  of bounded spectral norm. Our algorithm is inspired by one which uses the sum-of-squares
  semidefinite programming hierarchy (Ma, Shi, and Steurer STOCâ€™16), and we achieve
  comparable robustness and overcompleteness guarantees under similar algebraic assumptions.
  However, our algorithm avoids semidefinite programming and may be implemented as
  a series of basic linear-algebraic operations. We consequently obtain a much faster
  running time than semidefinite programming methods: our algorithm runs in time $\tilde
  O(n^2d^3) \le \tilde O(d^7)$, which is subquadratic in the input size $d^4$ (where
  we have suppressed factors related to the condition number of the input tensor).'
