abstract: Given a vector of probability distributions, or arms, each of which can
  be sampled independently, we consider the problem of identifying the partition to
  which this vector belongs from a finitely partitioned universe of such vector of
  distributions. We study this as a pure exploration problem in multi-armed bandit
  settings and develop sample complexity bounds on the total mean number of samples
  required for identifying the correct partition with high probability.  This framework
  subsumes  well studied problems such as finding the best arm or the best few arms.
  We consider distributions belonging to the single parameter exponential family and
  primarily consider partitions  where the vector of means of arms lie either in a
  given  set or its complement. The sets considered  correspond to distributions where
  there exists  a mean above a specified threshold, where the set is a half space
  and where either the set or its complement  is a polytope, or more generally, a
  convex set.  In these settings, we characterize the lower bounds on mean number
  of samples for each arm  highlighting  their dependence on the problem geometry.
  Further, inspired by the lower bounds, we propose algorithms  that can match these
  bounds asymptotically with decreasing probability of error.  Applications of this
  framework may be diverse.  We briefly discuss a few associated with  simulation
  in finance.
