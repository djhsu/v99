abstract: 'We provide excess risk guarantees for statistical learning in a setting
  where the population risk with respect to which we evaluate the target model depends
  on an unknown model that must be to be estimated from data (a “nuisance model”).
  We analyze a two-stage sample splitting meta-algorithm that takes as input two arbitrary
  estimation algorithms: one for the target model and one for the nuisance model.
  We show that if the population risk satisfies a condition called Neyman orthogonality,
  the impact of the nuisance estimation error on the excess risk bound achieved by
  the meta-algorithm is of second order. Our theorem is agnostic to the particular
  algorithms used for the target and nuisance and only makes an assumption on their
  individual performance. This enables the use of a plethora of existing results from
  statistical learning and machine learning literature to give new guarantees for
  learning with a nuisance component. Moreover, by focusing on excess risk rather
  than parameter estimation, we can give guarantees under weaker assumptions than
  in previous works and accommodate the case where the target parameter belongs to
  a complex nonparametric class. We characterize conditions on the metric entropy
  such that oracle rates—rates of the same order as if we knew the nuisance model—are
  achieved. We also analyze the rates achieved by specific estimation algorithms such
  as variance-penalized empirical risk minimization, neural network estimation and
  sparse high-dimensional linear model estimation. We highlight the applicability
  of our results in four settings of central importance in the literature: 1) heterogeneous
  treatment effect estimation, 2) offline policy optimization, 3) domain adaptation,
  and 4) learning with missing data.'
