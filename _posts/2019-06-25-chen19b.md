abstract: We propose the first contextual bandit algorithm that is parameter-free,
  efficient, and optimal in terms of dynamic regret. Specifically, our algorithm achieves
  $\mathcal{O}(\min\{\sqrt{KST}, K^{\frac{1}{3}}\Delta ^{\frac{1}{3}}T^{\frac{2}{3}}\})$
  dynamic regret for a contextual bandit problem with $T$ rounds, $K$ actions, $S$
  switches and $\Delta$ total variation in data distributions. Importantly, our algorithm
  is adaptive and does not need to know $S$ or $\Delta$ ahead of time, and can be
  implemented efficiently assuming access to an ERM oracle. Our results strictly improve
  the $\mathcal{O} (\min \{S^{\frac{1}{4}}T^{\frac{3}{4}}, \Delta^{\frac{1}{5}}T^{\frac{4}{5}}\})$
  bound of (Luo et al., 2018), and greatly generalize and improve the $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{ST})$
  result of (Auer et al., 2018) that holds only for the two-armed bandit problem without
  contextual information. The key novelty of our algorithm is to introduce {\it replay
  phases}, in which the algorithm acts according to its previous decisions for a certain
  amount of time in order to detect non-stationarity while maintaining a good balance
  between exploration and exploitation.
