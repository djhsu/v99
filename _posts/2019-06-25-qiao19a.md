abstract: 'We consider a model of selective prediction, where the prediction algorithm
  is given a data sequence in an online fashion and asked to predict a pre-specified
  statistic of the upcoming data points. The algorithm is allowed to choose when to
  make the prediction as well as the length of the prediction window, possibly depending
  on the observations so far. We prove that, even without any distributional assumption
  on the input data stream, a large family of statistics can be estimated to non-trivial
  accuracy. To give one concrete example, suppose that we are given access to an arbitrary
  binary sequence $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ of length $n$.  Our goal is to accurately predict
  the average observation, and we are allowed to choose the window over which the
  prediction is made: for some $t < n$ and $m \le n - t$, after seeing $t$ observations
  we predict the average of $x_{t+1}, \ldots, x_{t+m}$. This particular problem was
  first studied in Drucker (2013) and referred to as the “density prediction game”.
  We show that the expected squared error of our prediction can be bounded by $O(\frac{1}{\log
  n})$ and prove a matching lower bound, which resolves an open question raised in
  Drucker (2013). This result holds for any sequence (that is not adaptive to when
  the prediction is made, or the predicted value), and the expectation of the error
  is with respect to the randomness of the prediction algorithm. Our results apply
  to more general statistics of a sequence of observations, and we highlight several
  open directions for future work.'
