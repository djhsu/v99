abstract: 'In this work, we consider the sample complexity required for testing the
  monotonicity of distributions over partial orders.  A distribution $p$ over a poset
  is {\em monotone} if, for any pair of domain elements $x$ and $y$ such that $x \preceq
  y$, $p(x) \leq p(y)$. To understand the sample complexity of this problem, we introduce
  a new property called \emph{bigness} over a finite domain, where the distribution
  is $T$-big if the minimum probability for any domain element is at least $T$. We
  establish a lower bound of $\Omega(n/\log n)$ for testing bigness of distributions
  on  domains of size $n$. We then build on  these lower bounds to give $\Omega(n/\log{n})$
  lower bounds for  testing monotonicity over a matching poset of size $n$ and significantly
  improved lower bounds over the hypercube poset. We give sublinear sample complexity
  bounds for testing bigness and for testing monotonicity over the matching poset.   We
  then give a number of tools for analyzing upper bounds on the sample complexity
  of the monotonicity testing problem. '
